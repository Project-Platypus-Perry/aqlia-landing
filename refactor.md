2. HOME PAGE – EXACT SECTION-BY-SECTION COPY & INSTRUCTIONS

SECTION 1: HERO (ABOVE THE FOLD)
H1 (exact):Create JEE-grade tests in minutes, not days.
Subheading (exact):Aqlia eliminates manual test creation, evaluation, and analysis for mid-sized JEE institutes — without compromising question quality.
Primary CTA button:Book a demo
Secondary CTA (text link, optional):See how it works
Visual instruction:

SECTION 2: PROOF STRIP (DIRECTLY AFTER HERO)
Layout: Horizontal row of 4 proof points
Copy (exact):
95–99% question accuracy (Maths, Physics, Chemistry)
Test creation time: 8–10 days → under 1 minute
Built exclusively for JEE preparation
Already used by institutes with 5,000+ students (beta)

SECTION 3: THE PROBLEM
Heading:JEE institutes don’t struggle with teaching. They struggle with operations.
Body text:Running a JEE institute at scale means managing thousands of students, multiple batches, and constant assessments. Most institutes still rely on manual processes that slow everything down.
Bullet points (exact):
Faculty spend days creating and validating test papers
Question quality varies across batches and teachers
Evaluation and analysis take too long to act on
Scaling students increases operational chaos

SECTION 4: CORE SOLUTION – ASSESSMENT AUTOMATION
Heading:Replace the entire JEE assessment workflow.
Subheading:From question creation to performance analysis — fully automated.
Step blocks (exact):
1. Generate JEE-aligned questions instantlyCreate questions by selecting topic, difficulty, and format. Aqlia references JEE past papers, standard books, and your internal material.
2. Conduct tests across batchesDistribute tests digitally to students across batches without additional setup.
3. Auto-evaluate and analyze performanceInstant evaluation with topic-wise, student-wise, and batch-wise insights.
4. Reduce faculty workload significantlyFaculty focus on teaching and mentoring instead of repetitive manual work.
Visual instruction:
Use screenshots + short captions for each step

SECTION 5: WHY AQLIA
Heading:Built for Competative Exams
Bullet points (exact):
Designed specifically for JEE syllabus and exam patterns
